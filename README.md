  abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},

## Using egg

Add `egg` to your `Cargo.toml` like this:
```toml
[dependencies]
egg = "0.9.2"
```

Make sure to compile with `--release` if you are measuring performance!

## Developing

It's written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Typically, you install Rust using [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Run `cargo doc --open` to build and open the documentation in a browser.

Before committing/pushing, make sure to run `make`, 
 which runs all the tests and lints that CI will (including those under feature flags).
This requires the [`cbc`](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) solver
 due to the `lp` feature.

### Tests

Running `cargo test` will run the tests.
Some tests may time out; try `cargo test --release` if that happens.

There are a couple interesting tests in the `tests` directory:

- `prop.rs` implements propositional logic and proves some simple
  theorems.
- `math.rs` implements real arithmetic, with a little bit of symbolic differentiation.
- `lambda.rs` implements a small lambda calculus, using `egg` as a partial evaluator.


### Benchmarking

To get a simple csv of the runtime of each test, you set the environment variable
`EGG_BENCH_CSV` to something to append a row per test to a csv.

Example:
```bash
EGG_BENCH_CSV=math.csv cargo test --test math --release -- --nocapture --test --test-threads=1
```
